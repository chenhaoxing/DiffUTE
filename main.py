DiffUTE: Universal Text Editing Diffusion Model

This is the main entry point for the DiffUTE application. DiffUTE is a powerful
text editing system that uses diffusion models to modify text in images while
preserving the surrounding context.

The system consists of two main components:
1. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image encoding/decoding
2. A UNet-based diffusion model for text editing

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README.md file.
